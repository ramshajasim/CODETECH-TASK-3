OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT : Neural Style Transfer




🎯 📌 Project Objective
To implement a Neural Style Transfer model that applies artistic styles from one image (style image) to another image (content image), creating a visually stylized output.

🔑 Key Activities
Import and preprocess the content and style images.

Use a pre-trained model (like VGG19) to extract features from both images.

Calculate losses:

Content Loss: Difference between content features of generated and content images.

Style Loss: Difference in feature correlations (Gram matrices) of style and generated images.

Optimize the image: Update the generated image to minimize the combined loss.

Generate and save the stylized image output.
